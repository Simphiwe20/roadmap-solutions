                <p>My passion for IT started in varsity when it was time to do majors and i was the only one from my friends to pick BCom(Management Information Systems).</p>
                <p>We i was in then was completely glued even though it was a bit hard at time coz i had no mentor.</p>
                <p>Fast forward years back after my contract as an ICT intern ended, was invited at afrika tikkun to a Full Stack programme and i did.</p>
                <p>Was lucky enough to find a mentor there Mr.Mateka, a person i still admire alot his work ethic is on another level</p>
