                <h2>Operations Management System (2023)</h2>
                <p>This web-based system was developed using Angular, Express.js, and VS Code to automate various manual operations within organizations. The primary goal was to streamline internal processes such as leave requests, transport bookings, and visa applications, reducing paperwork and administrative overhead. By digitizing these workflows, the system improved efficiency, provided better tracking of requests, and ensured smoother communication between employees and management.</p>
                <h2>Medical Center System (2024)</h2>   
                <p>A group project built with AngularJS, Express.js, and VS Code, this system was designed to facilitate better coordination between doctors and patients. It allowed doctors to set their schedules while enabling patients to book appointments based on availability. With automated notifications and a secure authentication system, the platform helped reduce scheduling conflicts and waiting times, ultimately improving the overall healthcare experience for both medical professionals and patients.</p>
                <h2>Claims Management System (2024)</h2>
                <p>This web-based insurance claims management system was developed using Angular, Express.js, and VS Code as part of a group project. The platform aimed to make the claims process seamless by allowing users to submit claims online, track their status in real time, and facilitate communication between claimants and insurance providers. By automating document verification and approval workflows, the system minimized processing delays and enhanced transparency, leading to a more efficient and user-friendly insurance experience.</p>

                <h2>My Coding Journey: From Learning to Building</h2>
                <p>My journey into coding began with a simple curiosity—how do digital systems work? Over time, that curiosity turned into a deep passion for building web-based applications that solve real-world problems.</p>
                <p>One of my earliest major projects was the Operations Management System, developed using Angular and Express.js. The goal was to automate manual processes within organizations, such as leave requests, transport bookings, and visa applications. This project gave me hands-on experience in creating efficient workflows and optimizing business operations through technology.</p>
                <p>As my skills grew, I worked on a Medical Center System, a group project that focused on improving doctor-patient interactions. Using AngularJS and Express.js, we developed a platform where doctors could manage their schedules, and patients could book appointments based on availability. This project strengthened my ability to work in a team and reinforced the importance of user-friendly design in web applications.</p>
                <p>Another significant project I contributed to was the Claims Management System, aimed at streamlining the insurance claims process. By leveraging Angular and Express.js, our team built a system that allowed users to submit claims online, track their status, and facilitate communication between claimants and insurers. This experience deepened my understanding of integrating business logic with technology to create seamless digital solutions.</p>
                <p>Through these projects, I have gained extensive experience in full-stack development, working with Angular, Express.js, and Firebase deployment. My journey continues as I explore new frameworks, refine my coding skills, and take on more complex challenges in web development and cloud computing.</p>
